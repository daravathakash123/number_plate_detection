## About the Project:

- **Currently Ongoing - Website Integration on Flask**
- Vehicle Number Plate recognition System focuses on first detecting the number plate from vehicle.
- Means, Firstly taking the image of Vehicle , then extracting the Number Plate from it using technique for localization, segmentation and recognition of the characters within the located plate. 


### Some of its applications:

- Traffic safety enforcement
- Automatic toll collection
- Car park system Â
